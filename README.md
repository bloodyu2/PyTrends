# PyTrends

#This app uses PyTren and PyDrive as main libraries to connect to APIs.
#In order to use this you have to setup your Google Drive API at Google Cloud Developers first
#Download the secret file and store it in the same folder as your project
#Every API has to be different, otherwise you wont access your Drive nor upload the File

Enjoy!!
